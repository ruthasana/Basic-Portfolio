	   	    <p> Currently, I work as a Systems Administrator at GE Energy Connections, improving products and services for our customers by coordinating patch management and platform builds for the development and test environments.  As a result of my collaboration with development teams to design, implement test and development labs I am working towards becoming a software engineer able to work in  DevOps environment. 
			
			In order to achieve my goal, I have enrolled at the UCF Coding Boot Camp. At the end of this Fullstack Flex course, I will have gained practical knowledge in Browser Based Technologies, Computer Science Applied to JavaScript, PHP, Node.js, Quality Assurance, Database, Deployment and Internet Marketing.
